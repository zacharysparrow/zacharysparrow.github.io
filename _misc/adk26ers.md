The Adirondack mountains (a.k.a. the 'Dacks) in upstate New York are some of the most remote peaks in the Northeast United States. The High Peaks region, sporting ~46 peaks with an elevation over 4,000 feet, has become a popular hiking destination for people all around the world. Some of the East coast's best hikes are in the ADK region (looking at you, Great Range traverse). Hiking all 46 of the ADK high peaks is recognized as one of the greatest hiking challenges in the region. On 07/09/2023, my partner and I started our quest to become ADK 46ers before leaving Ithaca (likely 2028). Track out progress here!

## Trail Journal

### Cascade and Porter (2/46)
07/09/2023, Cascade Mountain Trail
- Very muddy, eroded trail on a cloudy day. Most difficult part was the terrain. Brought Jessie---we've never seen her jump so high! She loves wading through the mud.

### Marcy, Tabletop, and Phelps (5/46)
08/27/2023, Van Hoevenberg Trail
- Started out with just Tabletop and Phelps on the agenda, which we realized we would finish quickly. I had summitted Marcy before and knew we had the time, resources, and energy to tackle that peak, too, so we extended our day quite a bit! Ultimately hit Tabletop, Marcy, then Phelps. The day started out cloudy, but cleared up by the time we hit Phelps on the way back.

### Mount Allen (6/46)
09/16/23, East River Trail
- Why not knock out one of the hardest and most notorious peaks early? We had a lot of fun with this one. The approach was long and easy, with very muddy sections. The slide was quite slippery and difficult to navigate at times, and we ended up bushwacking to the right of the trail behind two other guys before spotting a trail runner and traversing back to the herd path. Ended up finding great views past the summit a bit! Great, beautiful day!

### Street and Nye (8/46)
03/02/2024, Indian Pass
- Our first winter hike in the 'Dacks. The original idea was to get some conditioning in before my trip to Rainier in the summer, so we went with my friend Jack with 35 lbs of deadweight in my pack. There was very little snow and ice when we started, but a decent amount closer to the summits. We had decent weather, but it was a little windy on the summits.

### Esther and Whiteface (10/46)
05/15/2024, Atmospheric Science Research Center
- Beautiful day! Cool and sunny at first, but started to heat up as we descended. Saw a beautiful sunrise on the top of Marble Mountain on the way up before hitting Esther, then Whiteface. The top of Whiteface was fairly empty when we got there (we were the first hikers and the visitor center had just opened up), but started filling up fast. We saw some red breasted nuthatches on the way down---it sounded like they were laughing at us!

### Dix Range (15/46)
08/31/2024, Hunter's Pass Trail
- The Dix Range is some of people's favorites, but wasn't ours. The day was wet, wet, wet, and our motto ended up being "I think that was the worst of it (it wasn't)." Summits were quite winder (30 mph or so). Going up Macoumb slide in the early morning fog was quite eerie, but very cool. Despite the weather, we had some solid type 2 fun and knocked out 5 peaks!
