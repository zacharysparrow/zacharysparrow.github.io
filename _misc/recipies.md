I have a few recipies that my family always request when I'm visiting home. I don't want to bring my cook books with me through the airport, so I compiled the most requested ones here so I have access to them on the road!

## World's Best Granola

I used to have this granola with yogurt for breakfast religiously for about a year. Honestly, nothing quite hits like baked oats with a little bit of sugar. While my breakfast has transitioned to oatmeal, this granola is still a fantastic occasional treat, and definitely worth the effort! Plus, it's a great little gift! Makes about 8 cups.

### Ingredients
Note that all nuts, seeds, and coconut should be raw
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup slivered almonds
- 1 cup pecans, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1/2 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/4 cup sesame seeds (optional)
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/4 melted coconut oil, plus a little extra
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 cup raisins

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F. Oil a 9x12 baking pan with the extra coconut oil (glass is best, everything else works fine).
2. Mix the oats, nuts, seeds, coconut, and salt together in a large bowl.
3. Thoroughly stir coconut oil into the nut mixture. Add the maple syrup and sugar, then stir well again.
4. Spread the mixture into the pan and bake for 18 min. Then, remove from the oven and stir in the raisins. Bake for another 10-12 minutes---careful not to burn the raisins!
5. Remove from oven and cool for about 1/2 hour.
6. Store in an airtight container.


## Peanut Butter French Toast
Ever wish french toast was a little bit more substantial? Do you put peanut butter on everything? This is the recipe for you! Makes about 8 sandwiches, depending on the loaf of bread.

### Ingredients
Cinnamon whipped cream
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract

French Toast
- 1 loaf brioche, cut THICK
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 4 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups while milk
- 3 tbs. bourbon (optional)
- 1 tbs. vanilla extract
- 1/2 tps. salt
- 3 cups crushed cornflakes
- 1 cup sliced almonds
- butter
- whatever toppings you want (berries, maple syrup, powdered sugar)

### Instructions
Make the whipped cream.
1. Whip the cream in a large bowl until it holds soft peaks. Add sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Whip until combined.

Make the french toast. 
2. Make peanut butter sandwiches with the bread and peanut butter.
3. Whisk together eggs, milk, bourbon, vanilla, and salt. In a seperate bowl, mix together conflakes and almonds.
4. One at a time, dip the sandwiches into the egg mixture. Press each sandwich into the cornflake mixture gently to adhere.
5. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with butter. Cook french toast in batches, about 3-4 min per side. Serve immediately.


## Spaghetti Sauce (worth the wait!)
A family favorite, perfect for an afternoon in. Start the sauce, then play boardgames while it simmers! Perfect for the garlic lovers out there. Serves 6-8 people.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 25-30 garlic cloves (that's not a typo)
- 1 tbs. dried oregano
- 1 tbs. dried basil
- 1 tbs. dried parsley
- red pepper flakes, to taste
- 2 24-ounce jars Marinara sauce (or make your own marinara!)
- salt and pepper
- 1 lb spicy italian sausage, no casings
- 1 lb spaghetti noodles (I prefer angel hair)
- your favorite spaghetti additions (parmesan, fresh herbs, garlic bread)

### Instructions
1. Combine the olive oil, garlic, oregano, basil, parsley, and as many red pepper flakes as you like in a large saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes, until the garlic is golden (careful not to burn it). Stir in the marinara sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Trust the process.
2. Roll sausage into grape-size meatballs and throw them in the saucepan. Stir it all together, then simmer on low for at least 3 hours, stiring roughly every hour. Resist the urge to turn up the heat.
3. Cook pasta according to the package instructions. Check meatballs are cooked through. Top with the sauce, and enjoy!
