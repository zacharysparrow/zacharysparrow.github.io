Postdoctoral research associate in computational chemistry transitioning into a data scientist role. I have a nearly decade of computational research experience with an emphasis on constructing and analyzing chemical data sets, the development of predictive machine learning models, and algorithm design.

## Education

- Ph.D. Computational Chemistry --- Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*May 2023*)							       		
- M.S. Computational Chemistry --- Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*Dec. 2019*)	 			        		
- B.A. Mathematics, B.A. Chemistry --- St. Olaf College, Northfield, MN (*May 2017*)

## Experience

### Postdoctoral Research Associate  
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*May 2023 - Present*)
- Machine learning for the design and recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)
- Algorithms for training robust and transferable machine-learned density functional approximations
- Quantum chemical database construction and analysis
<!---
- Engineered deep learning pipeline to guide the experimental valorization of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to pre-recycled strengths
- Developed sensitivity analysis technique to elucidate the roles of data and physical constraints on the accuracy of quantum chemistry approximations and suggest routes towards improvement
-->

### Graduate Research Assistant  
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*Aug. 2017 - May 2023*)
- Design of physically constrained empirical/machine-learned density functional approximations
- Linear-scaling exact exchange for large-scale finite-gap condensed-phase systems
- Quantum chemical database construction and analysis
<!---
- Constructed a new quantum chemical approximation that leverages both machine learning and physical principles, reliably decreasing error by ~15%
- Designed, built, and analyzed two benchmark-quality quantum chemical databases to diagnose shortcomings in approximate quantum chemistry methods, resulting in a new general error analysis framework
- Developed an efficient black box algorithm to estimate electron interaction energies in large-scale systems, thereby extending applicability to systems orders of magnitude larger than historically possible
- Selected to participate in fully funded 3 month long program to define future research goals for the field at the UCLA Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics
- Mentored 6 undergraduate researchers across 4 distinct quantum chemistry projects
-->

### Undergraduate Researcher
St. Olaf College, Northfield, MN (*Aug. 2015 - Aug. 2017*)
<!---
- Awarded competitive St. Olaf Center for Interdisciplinary Research Fellowship for outstanding research bridging chemistry, mathematics, and computer science
- Designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for high-resolution image analysis of high-speed gas flows
- Served as formal consultant for other undergraduate researchers with mathematics, statistics, and computer science questions
-->

### Visiting Undergraduate Research Assistant  
MIT, Cambridge, MA (*June 2015 - Aug. 2015*)
<!---
- Reconstructed historical Saharan dust transport over the Atlantic ocean by analyzing deep-sea sediment samples and modeling carbon-14 deposition rates using Gaussian Process regression
-->
