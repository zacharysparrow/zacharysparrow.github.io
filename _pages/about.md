Postdoctoral research associate in computational chemistry transitioning into a data scientist role. I have a nearly decade of computational research experience with an emphasis on constructing and analyzing chemical data sets, the development of predictive machine learning models, and algorithm design.

## Education

- Ph.D. Computational Chemistry --- Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*May 2023*)							       		
- M.S. Computational Chemistry --- Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*Dec. 2019*)	 			        		
- B.A. Mathematics, B.A. Chemistry --- St. Olaf College, Northfield, MN (*May 2017*)
